<hr/> 

WFP's logo is available in three versions: standard, vertical and
emblem. Each has its own purpose and should be used appropriately, as per
official branding guidelines, depending on available screen space and target
audience.

You can find extended information about the logo in the [branding guide](https://multimedia.wfp.org/Share/23tkan8b083764852o51171483myj8ex?FR_=1&W=1811&H=944).

> #### **Which file type shall I use?**
>
> Whenever possible use the svg files, since they are optimized with a small file size and will also serve HiDPI devices without problems. For printing
> please use [these](https://multimedia.wfp.org/Package/20SIJQCCJJL?WS=20SI40ER8SG) files.
